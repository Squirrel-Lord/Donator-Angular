# Donator
This is a dapp that let's Ethereum users donate to a smart contract.
An application such as this has a variety of use cases. This dapp showcases my
ability to develop smart contracts in Solidity and connect them to a client-facing
application using Web3.js. For this project, I utilized Angular Material and Routing
to allow for a seamless, intuitive user experience.
